    <h3>Life skills</h3>
<p>I can peel a whole fruit with one long thin strip. I believe that as long as I am patient and calm, I can finish peeling a fruit without stopping.</p>
<p>My entire mind focuses on that strip when I try to peel fruits in one long, thin strip. As I empty my mind of other things, I am refreshed from the process of just peeling fruits.<br>I enjoy the feeling of success after I finish peeling the fruit in one strip. This feeling boosts my confidence. And I believe this skill benefits my mind.</p>

    <h3>Travel experience</h3>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I traveled to an underdeveloped mountain area in Asia. Compared to the modern city where I lived, this poor area didn&apos;t make full use of its natural resources.</p>
<p>As the population grew, resources were becoming less available and pollution became an issue. I wanted to apply sustainable environment models to my community to make resources available to more people.</p>
